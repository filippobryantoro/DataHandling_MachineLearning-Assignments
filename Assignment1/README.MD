# Data Analysis Project

This project is focused on understanding business context through data analysis, cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights.

## Project Steps:

### 1. Understand Business Context
- Brainstorm with your group to define what you want to explore.
- Do you have a research question or a theory? Identify the **business problem** you're addressing.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- Assess the dataset for quality issues:
  - Fix missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
- Perform necessary transformations:
  - Create new variables and normalize data if appropriate.
- Merge data from multiple sources using appropriate joins (if needed).
- Summarize data using `groupby` to calculate relevant statistics (e.g., sums, averages).

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate basic statistics for key variables:
  - **Mean**
  - **Median**
  - **Variance**, etc.
- Explore data distributions with:
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Density plots

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- Conduct thorough EDA of your chosen dataset.
- Create insightful visualizationsâ€”avoid trivial visuals like pie charts:
  - Focus on revealing key insights through meaningful graphs.

## Key Takeaways:
- The steps in this project help you understand the business problem, clean and manipulate data, and visualize insights to make informed decisions.
